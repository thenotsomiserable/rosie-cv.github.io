              <p>Most of our main site content uses our in-house platforms. But we have some legacy systems which are
                not easily adaptable to existing templates. We still need to ensure that this content is accessible, so
                I've been tasked with re-skinning some of those platforms.</p>

      <p>I take on builds for individual clients, which can be on the client's preferred platform. This has tended to be
        through WordPress.</p>
      <p>I don't currently advertise due to time constraints but have built sites for client who have approached me by
        word of mouth.</p>
      <h2>Daniel Morley</h2>
      <h3>Brief</h3>
      <p>Create a new website for a self-employed artist. The site must include a blog and an online shop.</p>
      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>Daniel needed a brand new website. His main requirements were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to provide a place to view and buy his original artwork and prints</li>
        <li>to give his customers some insight into his practice and to let them know when and where he is exhibiting
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We discussed a range of options including Shopify and Squarespace. We decided to use WordPress due to the
        flexibility it allows. He wasn't sure that making online purchases would be the primary objective for his
        customers so didn't want to focus on the site being a shop.</p>
      <p>The project included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>domain and hosting set-up</li>
        <li>a purchased theme</li>
        <li>online shop setup using WooCommerce</li>
        <li>installing SSL certification</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Write Place</h2>
      <h3>Brief</h3>
      <p>Move existing non-profit organisation's site to a supported platform to enable responsive and accessible
        features and SSL.</p>
      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>The Write Place, a non-profit writers group had an existing site which was not responsive or accessible. They
        had a very low budget as they do not receive regular funding. The main focus was to get the content to a
        platform which would allow them to maintain the site themselves. They also had the pressure of time as their
        previous hosting provider was no longer able to support their site securely.</p>
      <p>I used a standard WordPress theme and created a child theme to allow them to give their site a bit of bespoke
        personality.</p>
      <p>The project included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>domain transfer and hosting set-up</li>
        <li>creation of a child theme</li>
        <li>translating old content to a new site and improving the accessibility</li>
        <li> installing SSL certification </li>
      </ul>
